    <string name="l14passage">"Today, we go to the zoo by car. There are many kinds of animals in the zoo. The big monkey teaches the little monkey to climb the mountain, the tiger mother washes the little tiger's face, the elephant sucks water with its long trunk, and the giant panda eats bamboo in the grass. The classmates liked them very much, and everyone said: \"Animals are our good friends.\" "</string>

    <string name="l15passage">"On Sunday, the weather was very sunny, and the school organized us to go on an outing. In the morning, we drove to the suburbs. The scenery there is particularly beautiful, with mountains and water. In the morning, we climbed mountains and flew kites. In the afternoon, we sang, danced and played hide-and-seek at the foot of the mountain. Everyone is very happy! "</string>
